# Navbat — appointment booking

> *Navbat* is Uzbek for "turn" or "queue".

Navbat is an appointment booking system for a small service business such as a
barbershop or clinic. Customers pick a service, see the free time slots of the
staff who offer it, and book one; the owner manages services, providers,
working hours and every booking's lifecycle (Pending → Confirmed → Completed,
or Cancelled). Double booking is prevented by the database itself, not just by
application code.

- **Live demo:** _TBD (P11)_
- **Demo credentials:** _TBD (P11)_ — admin and customer
- **CI:** _badge added in P0.6_

> Status: in development. Progress is tracked task by task in [`tasks.md`](tasks.md).

## Screenshots

_Added in P11.3: customer booking flow, admin dashboard._
